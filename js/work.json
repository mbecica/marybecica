This project proposes to daylight the pipe, turning the site into a wet water park connecting pedestrians from downtown to the Rivanna Trail. Terraces of agriculture and wetland mats filter and slow the water before returning it to the stream. Parametric tent structures rise out of the muck at intersections and significant views; they house the Governmental agencies and NGOs that are charged with protecting water resources and advising citizen farming initiatives.",
